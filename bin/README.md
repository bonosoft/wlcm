# WLCM
Wireless model train Layout Control for Modules

An easy to use and heavily extendable implementation of a train layout control system with a Message Queue (MQTT) for modules. Building and running model railroads in separate compatible modules has its pros and cons. The module standards (Fremo, Free-mo, NTrack, T-Trak) all defines the wiring and command control of driving and controlling trains. The only definition about controlling everything else (Turnouts, signals, lightning, track occupancyâ€¦) is that it must be completely separated from train controlling system. WLCM will help you control your modules, both at home, in your club and at events running with other module owners.

WLCM is the easy and simple way to control a large model train layout, and especially a large layout made by modules. Wiring up all the layout elements: lightning, signals, turnouts, crossings, etc. is a huge task, and the possibility for errors during installation and maintenance over time is a serious challenge for most. WLCM enable you to make small separate installations independent of each other, and all connected with a standard Wi-Fi wireless network.

## Download latest version
You can download the application as a single binary file. 

## Install application on your controller


## Configuration
First configuration step is to connect the controller to your wireless train network. When the application starts, it will enable a Wi-Fi access point for configuration.
